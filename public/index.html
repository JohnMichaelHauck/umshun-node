                        <h3>UmShun: A Multiplayer Game</h3>
                    </div>

                <div class="panel-body">
                    <p>UmShun is a delightfully competitive multi-player filler-word counting game. Play against classmates
                        and colleagues at lectures and presentations.</p>
                    <h3>Scoring</h3>
                    <p>Get the most points by being the first to press the correct button each time the speaker says “um”, “like”,
                        “uh”, or other filler-word. You get one point for each other player who presses the same word within
                        two seconds after you do - so be quick! Once you play a word, however, you are "locked out" of the
                        game for two seconds, so be wise.</p>
                    <h3>Warning</h3>
                    <p>Be warned that UmShun causes irreverent giggling, and may get you kicked out of class or fired, so try
                        extra hard to be considerate. Also, UmShun will distract you from listening to the speaker's content.</p>
                    <h3>Settings</h3>
                    <p>Type in a nickname for yourself. No need to use your real name, but don't be crude.</p>
                    <p>Type in a nickname for the speaker. Everyone needs to use the same speaker nickname (upper/lower case
                        does not matter). A very specific nickname helps prevent others from spoiling your fun.</p>
                    <p>Start with the nine words to play provided, but if your speaker frequently uses some other filler-word,
                        feel free to replace one of the words with that one. Of course, the only way you can score from that
                        word is if other players also play that word (upper/lower case does not matter).</p>
                    <h3>Play</h3>
                    <p>Just click one of the nine filler-word buttons every time you hear the speaker say it. After clicking
                        the word, you cannot play another word for two seconds.</p>
                    <h3>Score Board</h3>
                    <p>The top 10 player's nicknames will show up on the Score Board.</p>
                    <h3>Word Frequency</h3>
                    <p>The count of the number of times any player clicked a filler-word will show up on the Word Frequency.</p>
                    <h3>Ending the game</h3>

                    <p>Umshun can also be used as a tool to help speakers improve their presentations. With just one audience
                        member clicking filler-words as they hear them, the speaker can later review the Word Frequency for
                        constructive feedback.</p>
